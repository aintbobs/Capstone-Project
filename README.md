# Capstone Project ‚Äì MCU-Based Charcoal Briquette Machine

## üìñ Overview
This project is our **Capstone Project** for BS Computer Engineering.  
We developed an **MCU-Based Charcoal Briquette Machine** that automates the process of **grinding, mixing, compressing, and forming charcoal briquettes**.  
The goal is to improve efficiency, reduce human effort, and support sustainable fuel alternatives.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- Automated **charcoal feeding, mixing, and compression**
- **Load cell** integration for real-time weight monitoring
- **Ultrasonic sensors** for starch and water level detection
- **LCD I2C display** for system feedback
- **Servo motor & linear actuator** for material control
- **Relays** for controlling water pump and DC motor
- Safety indicators: LEDs + buzzer

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware & Software
- **MCU:** Arduino Mega (ATmega2560)
- **Sensors & Actuators:** IR sensor, servo motor, stepper motors, load cell (HX711), linear actuator, ultrasonic sensors, relays, LCD I2C
- **Programming Language:** C/C++ (Arduino IDE)
- **Design Tools:** AutoCAD (2D design), SketchUp (3D mechanical design)
